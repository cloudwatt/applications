# Applications

Cloudwatt provides cloud services type of IaaS (infrastructure on demand): servers, storage and network, while ensuring security, transparency, reversibility and location of data in France, all at the best cost.

The adoption of the cloud model depends on the ability of firms to start quickly their infrastructures. In particular, it must:

* Full easy-to-use cloud services,
* Open standard APIs,
* A choice of various applications

It is on this last point that Cloudwatt is continuing its efforts and is launching this week its first application stacks to easily deploy a website Wordpress and LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP).

This first will call in others. At a steady pace, Cloudwatt will publish on both its [technical blog](http://dev.cloudwatt.com/fr/blog/index.html) and on his github, application stacks and step-by-step deployment guides.

The procedure takes few minutes to prepare and 5 minutes to deploy.

Once the application stack is deployed, you become its master and can start to operate it immediately.

Faithful to its original choice of opensource, the [Cloudwatt library](https://www.cloudwatt.com/fr/applications/index.html) will grow in the coming weeks of application deployment stacks 100% opensource sources which will be shared in community mode.

If you have questions, comments, ideas for improvements please open an issue on Github or submit a pull request.

Stay tuned for the next episode!
